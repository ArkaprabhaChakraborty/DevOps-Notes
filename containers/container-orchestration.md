# Container Orchestration

## wHaT iS cOnTaInEr OrChEsTrAtIoN?

**Interview Definition:** Container orchestration is the automation of components and processes related to running containers. It includes things like configuring and scheduling containers, the availability of containers, allocation of resources between containers, and securing the interaction between containers, among other things.

**Real-world definition:** Containers are like dumb stubborn "chow chow" dogs. They need that prick in their lives to make our lives easier - hence container orchestration.&#x20;

## Why do we need container orchestration?
